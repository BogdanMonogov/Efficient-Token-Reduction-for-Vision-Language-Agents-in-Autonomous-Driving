# Efficient-Token-Reduction-for-Vision-Language-Agents-in-Autonomous-Driving
The following repository contains source code for evaluating different token-reduction techniques for VLMs 

All of the source code is stored in the Models folder, while the project presentation stored separately under the name "Presentation.pdf". 
Each filename in the folder reflects the name of the model used. All models are tested on the MVBench "Moving count" and "Action Sequence" datasets. Adopted metrics are acccuracy and computational time.
